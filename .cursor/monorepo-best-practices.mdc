- Use pnpm workspaces for efficient package management and dependency sharing
- Use Turbo for build optimization and task running across the monorepo
- Organize packages by domain (ui, schemas, sdk, i18n) for clear separation of concerns
- Use proper TypeScript project references for build optimization
- Implement proper shared configuration for ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript
- Use proper package versioning and dependency management
- Implement proper build caching with Turbo for faster builds
- Use proper task dependencies and parallel execution
- Implement proper package publishing and distribution
- Use proper workspace-specific scripts and commands
- Implement proper shared tooling and development utilities
- Use proper environment configuration across all packages
- Implement proper testing strategies across the monorepo
- Use proper documentation for package APIs and usage
- Implement proper change detection for affected packages
- Use proper build optimization with proper package boundaries
- Implement proper dependency graph management
- Use proper package isolation and encapsulation
- Implement proper shared types and interfaces
- Use proper build artifacts and distribution
- Implement proper development workflow optimization
